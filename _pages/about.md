About Me
=====
I'm now an undergraduate student majoring in Automation at Tsinghua University. My research intrest is Computer Vision. Recently, I'm reading the classic book in this field -- *Robot Vision*. I'm also interested in Computer Graphics, and I'm watching teaching videos of Prof. Linqi Yan. So, I want to blog my learning experience in this website. This is my first time to run a website and share my thoughts with others. Hope I can stick to it and learn more about CV & CG through it.
